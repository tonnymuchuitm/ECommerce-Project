# ECommerce-Project
This Project aims to analyse data from Olist, a popular E commerce store in Brazil. 
This project will have a power BI dashboard in phase 1 and a Predictive Machine Learning Model in phase 2.
In the first Phase I will create a Power BI management Dashboard. This dashboard will seek to analyse historical data for management reporting.
The main aim of this Dashboard is to enable the top level management perform self analytics on trends and patterns from historical data.

I will be carrying out this personal project over the next 3 Months. I am seeking to leverage on my extensive experience having worked as a Data Analyst consultant for a Leading firm in Sub-saharan Africa over the last 3 years. I have created, deployed and managed multiple Power BI dashboards for some of the leading companies in Africa over the course of my career.

I will be uploading pbix files based on set milestones. I will also be uploading Images of the dashboard pages for non-technical users.
