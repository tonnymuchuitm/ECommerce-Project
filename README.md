# ECommerce-Project
This Project aims to analyse data from Olist, a popular E commerce store in Brazil. 
This project will have a power BI dashboard in phase 1 and a Predictive Machine Learning Model in phase 2.
In the first Phase I will create a Power BI management Dashboard. This dashboard will seek to analyse historical data for management reporting.
The main aim of this Dashboard is to enable the top level management perform self analytics on trends and patterns from historical data.
