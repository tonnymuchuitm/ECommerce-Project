# ECommerce-Project
This Project aims to analyze data from Olist, a popular E-commerce store in Brazil. 
This project will have a power BI dashboard in phase 1 and a Predictive Machine Learning Model in phase 2.
In the first Phase I will create a Power BI management reporting Dashboard. This dashboard will seek to analyze sales data for management reporting.
The main aim of this Dashboard is to enable top-level management to perform self-analytics on trends and patterns from sales data.

I will be uploading pbix files based on set milestones. I will also be uploading Images of the dashboard pages for non-technical users.
